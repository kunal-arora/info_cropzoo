						<p class="section-text">Cropzoo is a result of what happens when you combine an idea with reality. What is now a regiestered brand under the company Frutta-E-Verdura, was earlier a nameless thought in the mind of few young boys. In our pursuit for competitive examinations, we studied the Indian Business Scenario, and we found that through persistent corruption and continued malpractices, a huge divde between Farmers and the end consumer has been created. This divide exists amongst us. At one end the farmer is dying because of insufficient renumeration for his produce, where on the other end, the consumer is dying for not being able to afford the extravagent prices for Fruits and Vegetables. This divide is a long chain of middle men, increasing the price of food each time it changes hands. In all Honesty, we today are not capable of fighting that long chain and solve the undying circumstances, but if it means anything, that is the direction that Cropzoo stands for. What the farmer wants at the end is fair money for his produce, which we realised that we could only provide by providing him with a consistent demand. Henceforth, currently, we at Cropzoo try extending our association with all types of Business bit by bit, aiming towards substituting a long unproductive chain. The Business In simpler words, we supply fruits and vegetables to Restaurants, Banquets, Base Kitchens and all kind of Food Processing Businesses. We procure items as per your demand. For Bulk orders going 1 Ton and up, we help source the item from the most feasible point of harvest. For smaller orders, we supply Fruits and Vegetables from Azadpur Mandi, the biggest Fruits and Vegetables market in Asia. We supply the kind of product as per your need. Our Process is to act as a team for our Client, catering end to end requirements.<br><br>
